## Abalone Age Prediction using Logistic Regression

This notebook demonstrates the application of Logistic Regression to predict the age of abalone based on physical measurements.

### Data Loading and Preprocessing

The abalone dataset was loaded and the 'Sex' column was removed as it is a categorical feature that would require further encoding for this model. The remaining features are numerical.

### Model Training

A Logistic Regression model was trained on the preprocessed data.

### Model Evaluation

The model's performance was evaluated using the training data. The accuracy score and the model's coefficients and intercept are displayed in the notebook.
